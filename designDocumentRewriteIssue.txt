Split subroutines and functions into separate files

Use global settings object
- Verify if settings file is broken, for example a settings variable entry is missing
- Verify if vlc path is correct

Combine Renamegui + Reviewgui and (re)move the tree view from renamegui as clip source and destination folder are only chosen once, at the start of the script
- have user select the recordings folder and show gui with treeview to select specific folder, in the same way the destination folder is chosen

Renamegui
- After showing message a file with chosen clip name already exists, focus on clip name input field
- Add ability to create a new folder to tree view context menu

Reviewgui
- Instead of closing the script without any warning when all clips in a folder have been sorted, move the folder into the recycle bin and prompt gui for selecting another folder
- Make skipping to the end of the clip optional
- Script does not always skip playback to 3/4 of 60 second clips
- Any way to make the script skip to the last 15 seconds of any clip? Regardless of clip length. Would need to read clip length somehow. or have gui element with amount of seconds to skip
- Show clip source folder path and (right) clicking it opens the folder
- Show clip count remaining in source folder < though this is already visible in windows explorer when you open the folder
- If the current clip does not exist (has already been deleted outside of the script) try to play the next clip or if the folder is now empty, continue with that

Clip folder select
- Replace inputbox with edit field with a FileSelectFolder dialog, use previously selected folder as StartingFolder. If StartingFolder does not exist, go up one level and try that one
  - Check if selected folder has any clips it in, if not ask to delete it and proceed to show the dialog again
